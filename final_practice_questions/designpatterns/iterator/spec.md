# Iterator Specification

* Implement a doubly linked list which uses the Iterator design pattern. It will need to provide an implementation for the decrement operator and reverse iteration.

* Write a seperator generic function called `filter` which takes in a start and end of an iterator, an empty list, and predicate function, and returns a new list that only contains the items which caused the predicate function to return true.
